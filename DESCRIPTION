Description: This package will implement a new proposed discrete time and continuous state space stochastic process model based on Weibull distribution.It works very effectively when there are ties  in two consecutive time points in the user-given time series data.The proposed stochastic process here is a lag-1 process.
    So,it will simply ask for time-series data from the user and then it will provide the test statistic for the model and it will also provide the corresponding p-value to understand how good the proposed model fits with the data.
